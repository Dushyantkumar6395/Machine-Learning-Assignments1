    "\n",
    "# Min-Max scaling, also known as normalization, is a data preprocessing technique used to rescale numeric features to a specific range, typically [0, 1]. It transforms the values of numerical features by scaling them to a fixed range, where the smallest value of the feature becomes 0 and the largest value becomes 1. The formula for Min-Max scaling is:\n",

    "\n",
    "# Unit Vector scaling is commonly used in applications where the relative orientation or direction of feature vectors matters more than their magnitude. For instance, in text mining or natural language processing (NLP), it is often used to normalize word vectors (word embeddings) in models like Word2Vec or GloVe, ensuring that semantically similar words have similar vector representations regardless of their frequency or occurrence.\n",

    "# Q5. You are working on a project to build a recommendation system for a food delivery service. The dataset\n",
    "# contains features such as price, rating, and delivery time. Explain how you would use Min-Max scaling to\n",
    "# preprocess the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Min-Max scaling is a technique used in data preprocessing to transform numerical features to a common scale, typically [0, 1]. This normalization ensures that all features contribute equally to the analysis and prevents features with larger scales from dominating the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### Steps to Use Min-Max Scaling for Preprocessing:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. **Understand the Data:**\n",
    "#    Examine the dataset containing features like price, rating, and delivery time. Each feature may have different ranges and units (e.g., price in dollars, rating on a scale of 1 to 5, delivery time in minutes).\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. **Apply Min-Max Scaling:**\n",
    "#    Implement Min-Max scaling to standardize the numeric features:\n",
    "   \n",
    "#    ```python\n",
    "#    from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler\n",
    "#    import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "#    # Example dataset\n",
    "#    data = {\n",
    "#        'price': [10, 20, 15, 25],  # Example prices in dollars\n",
    "#        'rating': [3.5, 4.2, 3.8, 4.5],  # Example ratings (scale 1-5)\n",
    "#        'delivery_time': [30, 25, 35, 40]  # Example delivery times in minutes\n",
    "#    }\n",
    "\n",
    "#    df = pd.DataFrame(data)\n",
    "\n",

    "#    df_scaled = pd.DataFrame(scaled_data, columns=df.columns)\n",
    "#    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. **Interpret Scaled Data:**\n",
    "#    Review the transformed data to ensure all features are scaled to the range [0, 1]:\n",
    "   \n",
    "#    ```python\n",
    "#    print(df_scaled)\n",
    "#    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#    The output will show each feature scaled proportionally within the range [0, 1].\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### Benefits of Min-Max Scaling:\n",
    "\n",
    "# - **Equal Contribution:** Ensures all features contribute equally to the analysis, preventing features with larger scales from dominating.\n",
    "  \n",
    "# - **Maintains Relationships:** Preserves the relationships and distributions of the original data within a normalized scale.\n",
    "  \n",
    "# - **Algorithm Compatibility:** Ensures compatibility with algorithms that require features to be on the same scale, such as gradient descent in neural networks or clustering algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### Use Case Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "# For a food delivery recommendation system:\n",
    "# - **Price:** Normalize prices of food items (e.g., $10 to $25) to [0, 1].\n",
    "# - **Rating:** Scale ratings (e.g., 3.5 to 4.5) to [0, 1].\n",
    "# - **Delivery Time:** Transform delivery times (e.g., 25 to 40 minutes) to [0, 1].\n",
    "\n",
    "# By applying Min-Max scaling to these features, you ensure that price, rating, and delivery time are uniformly scaled, allowing your recommendation system to consider each attribute equally when suggesting food items to users.\n",

    "# Suppose the dataset contains 5 numeric features: height, weight, age, blood pressure, and a categorical feature like gender (which would need encoding before PCA). After encoding and standardizing, you find that:\n",
    "\n",
    "# - PCA shows that the first 3 principal components explain 90% of the variance in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "# In this scenario, retaining 3 principal components would be reasonable because they capture a significant portion (90%) of the dataset's variance. This reduces the dimensionality from 5 original features to 3 principal components, facilitating simpler modeling and potentially improving model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### Why Choose 3 Principal Components?\n",
    "\n",
    "# - **Dimensionality Reduction:** Reducing from 5 features to 3 components simplifies modeling and reduces computational complexity.\n",
    "  \n",
    "# - **Variance Retention:** Retaining 90% of the variance ensures that most of the information in the original dataset is preserved.\n",
    "\n",
    "# - **Interpretability:** Fewer components are easier to interpret and explain compared to the original features.\n",
