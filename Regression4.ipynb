    "# Q1. What is Elastic Net Regression and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
    "# Elastic Net Regression is a type of regularized linear regression that combines two different penalties, the L1 (lasso) and L2 (ridge) penalties, to enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability of the model. It is particularly useful when dealing with datasets with highly correlated predictors or when the number of predictors exceeds the number of observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### Key Features of Elastic Net Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. **Combination of L1 and L2 Regularization:**\n",
    "#    - **L1 Regularization (Lasso):** Adds the absolute value of the coefficients as a penalty term to the loss function. It can shrink some coefficients to exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection.\n",
    "#    - **L2 Regularization (Ridge):** Adds the squared value of the coefficients as a penalty term. It shrinks the coefficients but does not set any of them to zero, thus retaining all features.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. **Elastic Net Penalty:**\n",
    "#    - The penalty term in Elastic Net is a convex combination of the L1 and L2 penalties. It can be expressed as:\n",
    "#      \\[\n",
    "#      \\alpha \\cdot L1\\_penalty + (1 - \\alpha) \\cdot L2\\_penalty\n",
    "#      \\]\n",
    "#      where \\( \\alpha \\) is a parameter between 0 and 1 that controls the mix of the penalties.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. **Flexibility:**\n",
    "#    - By tuning the parameter \\( \\alpha \\), Elastic Net can approximate Lasso (\\( \\alpha = 1 \\)) or Ridge (\\( \\alpha = 0 \\)) regression, or be somewhere in between.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### Differences from Other Regression Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression:**\n",
    "#    - OLS minimizes the residual sum of squares without any regularization.\n",
    "#    - It may perform poorly with multicollinearity and when the number of predictors is large.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. **Ridge Regression:**\n",
    "#    - Adds L2 regularization to the loss function to handle multicollinearity by shrinking the coefficients.\n",
    "#    - Retains all features but reduces their magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. **Lasso Regression:**\n",
    "#    - Adds L1 regularization to the loss function.\n",
    "#    - Can perform feature selection by shrinking some coefficients to exactly zero.\n",
    "#    - May struggle with highly correlated features, as it tends to select one feature from a group and ignore others.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. **Elastic Net Regression:**\n",
    "#    - Combines both L1 and L2 penalties, providing a balance between feature selection and coefficient shrinkage.\n",
    "#    - More effective than Lasso when dealing with highly correlated features, as it can select groups of correlated features together.\n",
    "#    - Offers better generalization by controlling overfitting more effectively than Lasso and Ridge alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### Mathematical Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "# The objective function for Elastic Net Regression is:\n",
    "# \\[\n",
    "# \\min_{\\beta} \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{2N} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\left( y_i - \\beta_0 - \\sum_{j=1}^p x_{ij} \\beta_j \\right)^2 + \\lambda \\left( \\alpha \\sum_{j=1}^p |\\beta_j| + \\frac{1 - \\alpha}{2} \\sum_{j=1}^p \\beta_j^2 \\right) \\right\\}\n",
    "# \\]\n",
    "# where:\n",
    "# - \\( N \\) is the number of observations,\n",
    "# - \\( p \\) is the number of predictors,\n",
    "# - \\( y_i \\) is the response variable,\n",
    "# - \\( x_{ij} \\) are the predictor variables,\n",
    "# - \\( \\beta_0 \\) is the intercept,\n",
    "# - \\( \\beta_j \\) are the coefficients,\n",
    "# - \\( \\lambda \\) is the regularization parameter,\n",
    "# - \\( \\alpha \\) controls the mix of L1 and L2 penalties.\n",
    "\n",
    "# In summary, Elastic Net Regression offers a robust approach for regression modeling by combining the strengths of both Lasso and Ridge regression, making it suitable for datasets with complex feature relationships and high-dimensional data."

    "# Choosing the optimal values of the regularization parameters for Elastic Net Regression involves using techniques such as cross-validation. Here’s a concise process:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. **Grid Search:** Define a grid of potential values for the regularization parameters \\( \\alpha \\) (mixing parameter) and \\( \\lambda \\) (overall regularization strength).\n",
    "# 2. **Cross-Validation:** Perform k-fold cross-validation for each combination of \\( \\alpha \\) and \\( \\lambda \\) values on the training dataset.\n",
    "# 3. **Evaluation Metric:** Choose an appropriate evaluation metric (e.g., mean squared error) to assess model performance during cross-validation.\n",
    "# 4. **Model Fitting:** For each fold, fit the Elastic Net model and compute the evaluation metric.\n",
    "# 5. **Averaging:** Calculate the average performance metric across all folds for each combination of parameters.\n",
    "# 6. **Optimal Parameters:** Select the combination of \\( \\alpha \\) and \\( \\lambda \\) that results in the best average performance.\n",
    "# 7. **Refinement:** Optionally, refine the search by narrowing down the parameter grid around the best-performing values and repeat the process.\n",
