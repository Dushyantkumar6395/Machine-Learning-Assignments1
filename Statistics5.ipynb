    "Certainly! Let's address each question in turn:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q1: What is Estimation Statistics? Explain point estimate and interval estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Estimation Statistics** involves using sample data to estimate population parameters. There are two main types of estimation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Point Estimate**: A single value that serves as the best estimate of an unknown population parameter. For example, the sample mean (\\(\\bar{x}\\)) is often used as a point estimate of the population mean (\\(\\mu\\)).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Interval Estimate**: A range of values within which the population parameter is estimated to lie, along with a level of confidence. It provides a more informative estimate than a single point and accounts for the uncertainty inherent in sampling. For example, a confidence interval around the sample mean provides an interval estimate of the population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2: Write a Python function to estimate the population mean using a sample mean and standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a Python function to calculate the confidence interval for the population mean using a sample mean, standard deviation, sample size, and desired confidence level:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import scipy.stats as stats\n",
    "\n",
    "def confidence_interval(sample_mean, sample_std, sample_size, confidence_level):\n",
    "    z_critical = stats.norm.ppf(1 - (1 - confidence_level) / 2)\n",
    "    margin_of_error = z_critical * (sample_std / (sample_size ** 0.5))\n",
    "    lower_bound = sample_mean - margin_of_error\n",
    "    upper_bound = sample_mean + margin_of_error\n",
    "    return lower_bound, upper_bound\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example usage:\n",
    "sample_mean = 50\n",
    "sample_std = 5\n",
    "sample_size = 100\n",
    "confidence_level = 0.95\n",

    "print(f\"Confidence Interval ({confidence_level*100}%): ({lower}, {upper})\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3: What is Hypothesis testing? Why is it used? State the importance of Hypothesis testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis testing** is a statistical method used to make inferences about a population based on sample data. It involves:\n",
    "- Formulating a hypothesis (null and alternative),\n",
    "- Collecting and analyzing data,\n",
    "- Drawing conclusions about the population based on the data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Importance**:\n",
    "- **Decision Making**: It helps in making decisions and drawing conclusions based on evidence from data.\n",
    "- **Scientific Research**: Essential for testing theories and hypotheses in scientific research.\n",
    "- **Quality Control**: Used in industries to ensure products meet specifications.\n",
    "- **Policy Making**: Provides empirical evidence for making informed policy decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing ensures that conclusions drawn from data are reliable and based on solid statistical principles, contributing to the rigor and validity of scientific and practical investigations."
